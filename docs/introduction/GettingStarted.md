We will walk you through adding Fewer to an existing Node.js application.

## Installation

To install the latest version of fewer:

```bash
npm install --save fewer
```

You'll likely also want to globally install the fewer CLI to help scaffold things out:

```bash
npm install --global @fewer/cli
```

## Initialize your project

The fewer CLI can add support to your existing project

```bash
fewer init
```

Fewer will generate the following folders and files into your project.

```
my-project/
    src/
        migrations/
            example.ts
        repositories/
            index.ts
            example.ts
        db.ts
        schema.ts
```

You can rename these files and folders, they are only generated based on community conventions. Fewer does not require or enforce any project structure.

Open the **`db.ts`** file to configure your database connection:

```ts
import { createDatabase } from 'fewer';
import { MySQLAdapter as Adapter } from '@fewer/adapter-mysql';

export default createDatabase({
  adapter: new Adapter({
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3306,
    username: 'test',
    password: 'test',
    database: 'test',
  }),
});
```

You'll need to initiate the connection to the database in your code, so open up the entry point to your application, and add the following lines:

```ts
import db from './db';

db.connect();
```
